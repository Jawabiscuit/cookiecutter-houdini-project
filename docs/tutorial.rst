To start with, you will need a `GitHub account`_ and an account on `PyPI`_. Create these before you get started on this tutorial. If you are new to Git and GitHub, you should probably spend a few minutes on some of the tutorials at the top of the page at `GitHub Help`_.

Step 1: Install Cookiecutter
----------------------------

First, you need to create and activate a virtualenv for the package project. Use your favorite method, or create a virtualenv for your new package like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/mypackage

Here, ``mypackage`` is the name of the package that you'll create.

Activate your environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    source bin/activate

On Windows, activate it like this. You may find that using a Command Prompt window works better than gitbash.

.. code-block:: powershell

    > \path\to\env\Scripts\activate

Install cookiecutter:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cookiecutter

`conda`_ and `miniconda`_ are nice alternatives to virtualenv. I prefer miniconda since the installation is very minimal.

.. _`conda`: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda
.. _`miniconda`: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

With either of those installed, creating and activating and environment looks like...

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n cookiecutter python=3
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install cookiecutter
    activate cookiecutter

For conda to work in powershell (tested on v6) an initial script needs to be run

.. code-block:: powershell

    conda init powershell

Powershell also seems to work better prefixing each activate/deactivate command with ``conda``. Also
conda will load the base environment automatically every new powershell. It might be necessary to
deactivate it if you want to run a different, non-conda python exe.

.. code-block:: powershell

    conda activate cookiecutter
    conda deactivate

Of course, you could run ``venv`` (interchangeable with virtualenv) inside a conda env if desired.
There have been `some known issues`_, but it seems viable.

Step 2: Generate Your Package
-----------------------------

Now it's time to generate your Python package.

Use cookiecutter, pointing it at the cookiecutter-houdini-project repo:

.. code-block:: bash

    cookiecutter https://github.com/Jawabiscuit/cookiecutter-houdini-project.git

You'll be asked to enter a bunch of values to set the package up.
If you don't know what to enter, stick with the defaults.


Step 3: Create a GitHub Repo
----------------------------

Go to your GitHub account and create a new repo named ``mypackage``, where ``mypackage`` matches the
``[project_slug]`` from your answers to running cookiecutter.

``If your virtualenv folder is within your project folder, be sure to add the virtualenv folder name to your .gitignore file.``

You will find one folder named after the ``[project_slug]``. Move into this folder, and then setup git to use your GitHub repo and upload the code:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd mypackage
    git init .
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin git@github.com:myusername/mypackage.git
    git push -u origin master

Where ``myusername`` and ``mypackage`` are adjusted for your username and package name.

You'll need a ssh key to push the repo. You can `Generate`_ a key or `Add`_ an existing one.

.. _`Add`: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/


Step 4: Install Dev Requirements
--------------------------------

You should still be in the folder containing the ``requirements_dev.txt`` file.

Your virtualenv should still be activated. If it isn't, activate it now. Install the new project's local development requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt


Step 5: Set Up Read the Docs
----------------------------

`Read the Docs`_ hosts documentation for the open source community. Think of it as Continuous Documentation.

Log into your account at `Read the Docs`_ . If you don't have one, create one and log into it.

If you are not at your dashboard, choose the pull-down next to your username in the upper right, and select "My Projects". Choose the button to Import the repository and follow the directions.

Now your documentation will get rebuilt when you make documentation changes to your package.
